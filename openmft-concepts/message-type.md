# 2.2 Message Type

* Message Type is an arbitrary name given to uniquely identify a document type or a transaction type. This field is primary used for registration, and routing purposes so the appropriate workflow can be invoked for any message or file.  In the case of EDI data, this value comes from ST01 in ANSI ASC X12 OR UNH02/1 in UN/EDIFACT standards.  For non-EDI data, oneâ€™s imagination is the only limit on what the message type can be.
  * EDI Data:  Data for content based routing scenarios can be identified by the position of values in the elements described above.  Some examples\(given in X12&lt;-&gt;EDIFACT equivalent formats\) are: 850&lt;-&gt;ORDERS , 855&lt;-&gt;ORDRSP, 856&lt;-&gt;DESADV, 810&lt;-&gt;INVOIC, 820&lt;-&gt;REMADV, 830&lt;-&gt;DELFOR, 832&lt;-&gt;PRICAT, 997&lt;-&gt;CONTRL.  This WikiPedia link will give you the complete list: [X12 EDIFACT Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X12_EDIFACT_Mapping).  
  * Non-EDI:  Data for file based routing scenarios can be identified by the business function the document or message belongs to.  Here is a few of the message types we have seen in the non-EDI world are GENERIC, LOANDOC, LOAN\_ACK, LOAN\_RPT, INVOICE, PAYMENT, SHIPMENT, REPORT, etc.
* OpenMFT, by default is not configured for automatic EDI parsing.  It is only built for File based routing where the mapping of the Sender to a Receiver & Message Type has to be done in Message Mapping screen.
