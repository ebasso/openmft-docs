# 2.6 User Communication Profiles

### 2.6.1 Setting up an outbound SFTP Communication

If a User is listening on an SFTP server and we need to push files to them, these steps would help configuring the outbound or MFT initiated communication profile:

* Select Protocol from the dropdown list -&gt; SFTP
* Give a Profile Name
* Type -&gt; Select MFT Initiated radio button
* Enter the values for the following fields:

  * Remote Host
  * Remote port \(One could automatically retrieve the known host key of the remote host by clicking on the gear icon next to Remote Port. \)
  * Remote User Id
  * Auth Type
    * If Auth Type is Key or Password and Key, then a link to the public key of the server is given next to the Auth Type so one could send it to the Customer.
  * Use Source File Name
  * Remote File Name if "User Source File Name" is not checked
  * Remote Path
  * Use temp filename if it is required to use a temporary suffix before the file transfer is complete
