or a Customer or a Vendor or Supplier in other B2B platforms or a node or queue or topic in messaging systems.  A User can be either a Sender or Receiver or both depending on the situation. While the identification of Sender and Receiver is automatically done by the Parsers in the case of EDI from ISA segment in X12 or UNB segment in EDIFACT, Receiver and Message type can be Registered for non-EDI data either by writing a custom parser or by associating the file pattern with the Sender to a specific Message Type and Receiver using Message mapping.
