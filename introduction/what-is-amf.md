# 1.3 What is AMF and why OpenMFT?

AMF \(Agile Messaging Framework\) was originally created in a commercial setting by Agile Data Inc to solve the following challenges for IBM Sterling Supply Chain customers using IBM Sterling File Gateway or IBM Sterling Global High Availability Mailbox:  
 - Rapid on-boarding - Standardize on-boarding of trading partners and communication protocols with repeatable actions orchestrated by workflows  
 - Global processing - Provide a distributed processing workflow engine that allows customers to have a scalable processing capability across data centers and/or cloud providers  
 - Guaranteed delivery - Decouple the delivery from processing and guarantees the delivery despite the target environment's availability at the time of transfer.    
 - Granular traceability - Ability to ingest all events that originate from the framework to an event mesh that can be aggregated in an analytical platform of choice.  
  
Our experience with building AMF for customers made us realize that AMF has a lot to offer and should be used by all IBM Sterling Supply Chain customers.  We also realized that there is no opensource MFT framework or a product that is out there, which is generic enough to integrate with most vendors.  So, we began our journey with IBM Sterling Supply Chain and built the world's first OpenSource Application Framework meant for Managed File Transfer \(MFT\) and integrated with Sterling File Gateway. 

OpenMFT is made possible by Agile Data Inc from the [successful implementations of AMF](https://www.agiledatainc.com/agile-amf-case-study/).  OpenMFT provides near real-time visibility into messages processed, messages queued for delivery, and also provide an intuitive and consistent experience for on-boarding among other features.
