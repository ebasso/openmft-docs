# 1.2 Typical routing patterns for MFT/B2B systems

There are generally two ways in which most MFT/B2B platforms do routing.  They are either routing based on the **file pattern** or based on some **content inside** the file or message.  This process of looking into the file or message is often referred to as Parsing.  Generic Parsers play a key role for a properly engineered middle-ware platform.
