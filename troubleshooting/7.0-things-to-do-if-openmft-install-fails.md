# 7.0 Things to do if OpenMFT install fails

### 7.0.1 Ensure Vault is up and running

```text
ps -ef|grep vault |grep openmft
# if the above command shows any vault service up, then try to unseal
om -unseal vault
# if the above command doesn't work, try
om -restart vault # This should stop and start vault again
```

### 7.0.2 Configure OpenMFT &lt;-&gt; SFG Integration

If OpenMFT install fails, we can run the below command that will setup the integration between OpenMFT and SFG.

{% hint style="info" %}
This command is automatically triggered when OpenMFT is installed and doesn't need to be run unless OpenMFT installer fails because of Vault or other reasons.
{% endhint %}

```text
cd $OPENMFT_BASE
./om -install sfg
```

Above "openmftdistro" command with the -deploy sfg and -mode install flags does the following tasks automatically: 

* Stop SFG
* Install the following 3rd Party Jars:
  * openmft.jar
  * postgresql-42.2.12.jar
  * stringtree-json-2.0.5.jar
  * Install openmft Java service:
    * OpenmftService.jar
* Start SFG
* Import BPs
* Import AMFService
* \(Optional\) Import SFTP and CDSA adapters.  One can disable these adapters, configure their own or re-use existing ones. 
* Import Schedule
