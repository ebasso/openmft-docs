# 3.2 Download & stage OpenMFT

## 3.2.1 Create a base path

In our example, we created /apps, but you can create any folder under your user account where you have at least 10 GB or more.  Update .bash\_profile with OPENMFT\_BASE variable for basepath and add $OPENMFT\_BASE/openmft/bin to PATH:

```text
export OPENMFT_BASE=/apps
export PATH=$PATH:$OPENMFT_BASE/openmft/bin
```

Activate the bash\_profile:

```text
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## 3.2.2 Getting Super Powers starts with downloading amazing software

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process.  Start by downloading below files into the base path.  You can either click on these links:

* [https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/om](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/om)
* [https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft\_schema.sql](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_schema.sql)
* [https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft\_template.conf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_template.conf)

If the software is downloaded using the links above to either a Windows or a Mac, the files could be transferred to the target Linux server using SFTP. 

OR directly download them from command line using wget on Linux:

```text
cd /apps/
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/om
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_schema.sql
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_template.conf
```



##  3.2.3 Copy openmft\_template.conf to openmft.conf and update it

Copy openmft\_template.conf file or rename it to openmft.conf:

```text
cp openmft_template.conf openmft.conf
```

Below is an example of openmft.conf.  Update the following properties per site settings:

* basepath
* Favicon, Logo and Copyright if you want to customize the branding 
* log file settings if logs need to go a specific folder
* DATABASE section is meant for the OpenMFT Database.  
  * dburl -&gt; User, pwd, host, port \(default=5432\) & database values have to be updated in this format: "postgres://user:pwd@host:port/database?sslmode=disable" 
* SFG section is where SFG\_HOME \(base\) directory and other SFG related details are configured
* VAULT\_HOME will be created when OpenMFT is installed and address in VAULT\_ADDR may need to be changed to  your host name.
