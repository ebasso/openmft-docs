# 3.2 Download & stage OpenMFT

## 3.2.1 Create a base path

In our example, we created /apps, but you can create any folder under your user account where you have at least 10 GB or more.  Update .bash\_profile with OPENMFT\_BASE variable for basepath and add $OPENMFT\_BASE/openmft/bin to PATH:

```text
export OPENMFT_BASE=/apps
export PATH=$PATH:$OPENMFT_BASE/openmft/bin
```

Activate the bash\_profile:

```text
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## 3.2.2 Getting Super Powers starts with downloading amazing software

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process.  Start by downloading below files into the base path.  You can either click on these links:

* [https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/om](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/om)
* [https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft\_schema.sql](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_schema.sql)
* [https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft\_template.conf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_template.conf)

If the software is downloaded using the links above to either a Windows or a Mac, the files could be transferred to the target Linux server using SFTP. 

OR directly download them from command line using wget on Linux:

```text
cd /apps/
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/om
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_schema.sql
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.openmft.org/openmft_template.conf
```



##  3.2.3 Copy openmft\_template.conf to openmft.conf and update it

Copy openmft\_template.conf file or rename it to openmft.conf:

```text
cp openmft_template.conf openmft.conf
```

Below is an example of openmft.conf.  Update the following properties per site settings:

* basepath
* Favicon, Logo and Copyright if you want to customize the branding 
* log file settings if logs need to go a specific folder
* DATABASE section is meant for the OpenMFT Database.  The information in the template is an example, please change it to your standards.
* SSL\_CERTIFICATE section is for you to either have the installer create a self-signed cert or for you to add existing certs.
* SFTPD\_SERVICE section is for you to define the hostname and port that you want to listen on for SFTP.  This will be your SFTP server that will be launched along with the core OpenMFT services.
* SFG section is where SFG\_HOME \(base\) directory and other SFG related details are configured
* VAULT section has VAULT\_HOME that will be created when OpenMFT is installed and address in VAULT\_ADDR may need to be changed to  your host name if you want to login to the UI.
