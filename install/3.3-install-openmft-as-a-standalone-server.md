# 3.3 Install OpenMFT as a standalone server

## 3.3.1 OpenMFT can be run standalone with its own SFTP server

OpenMFT relies on the following components:

* PostgreSQL DB as mentioned in the [pre-requisites section](pre-requisites.md)
* OpenMFT can be installed in the same server as postgres for development or testing purposes, but can also be configured as a cluster where each component could be split. 

```text
# These are all the options for install, one can pick and choose which 
# components to install, but dbschema & vault are one time tasks for the 
# entire cluster if a multi-node cluster is being provisioned with 
# svc, certs & ui separately on each node.
./om -install dbschema,vault,certs,svc,ui
```

## 3.3.2 Install demo use cases

Demo use cases\(scenarios\) could be installed to visualize the platform and experience it first hand with an automated flow.  There are 4 industry use cases created for the following domains:

* Banking
* HealthCare
* Retail
* Logistics

```text
# From your base path, run the below commands to install one or all of the use cases
om -installdemo banking
om -installdemo healthcare
om -installdemo retail
om -installdemo logistics
```

## 3.3.3 Run demos
